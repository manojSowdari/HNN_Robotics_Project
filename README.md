How to Run the Project
Simulation and Data Collection:

Run the simulation script (e.g., single-joint-system.py) to simulate the robotic system in headless mode and generate trajectory data.
The script uses PyBullet in DIRECT mode and saves the recorded states to control_loop_output.npy.
Control Loop:

The control loop applies a naive torque search to drive a selected joint toward a desired angle.
You can modify the q_des (desired joint angle) and the torque candidate range to experiment with different control strategies.
Visualizing the Data:

Use provided or custom Python scripts/notebooks to load the .npy file, analyze, and plot the joint angle and velocity over time with Matplotlib.
Training an HNN (Future Work):

Although this project focuses on simulation and control, the next steps could include training a Hamiltonian Neural Network on the collected simulation data to learn the systemâ€™s dynamics.
Pushing Code to GitHub
We set up Git on the Azure compute instance, configured safe directory settings, and pushed our code using a Personal Access Token (PAT). The basic commands we used were:

bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from Azure ML compute instance"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/HNN_Robotics_Project.git
git push -u origin master
For renaming branches or force pushing, please refer to the Git documentation.

Future Work
Advanced Control:
Integrate the HNN with the control loop for model-based control.
Improved Simulation:
Experiment with different URDFs, tuning joint parameters, and using symplectic integrators.
Experiment Tracking:
Use Azure ML experiment tracking to log metrics and compare different control strategies.
