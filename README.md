## Overview
This project serves as an end-to-end demonstration of:
1. **Robotics Simulation:** Using [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) in headless mode (i.e., `p.DIRECT`) to simulate robotic systems such as the KUKA iiwa or R2D2 models.
2. **Naive Control Loop:** A simple torque control loop that applies a range of candidate torques to a chosen joint, driving it toward a desired setpoint.
3. **Data Collection:** Generating `.npy` files containing joint angles and velocities (or states) over time for later analysis or HNN training.
4. **Version Control:** Managing code on an Azure Machine Learning compute instance and pushing to GitHub using Git.
5. **Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNN) Foundation:** Scripts and placeholders that outline how to train an HNN on collected simulation data (e.g., `train_hnn.py`, `validate_hnn.py`), although advanced integration is left for future work.

---

## Features
- **Headless Simulation:** Runs PyBullet without a GUI—ideal for cloud environments like Azure ML.
- **Simple Control Strategy:** Demonstrates a naive approach for joint control, searching over candidate torques to minimize error from a desired angle.
- **Data Logging:** Records joint states (angle, velocity) into NumPy arrays for easy plotting or training a neural network.
- **HNN Training Scripts (Prototype):** Shows how you might structure a training script to learn Hamiltonian dynamics from simulation data.

 ```

4. **PyTorch (Optional, for HNN)**  
   ```bash
   pip install torch
   ```
5. **Azure ML Environment (Optional but recommended)**  
   - An Azure Machine Learning workspace with a compute instance or a standard VM to run headless simulations.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manojSowdari/HNN_Robotics_Project.git
   cd HNN_Robotics_Project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - If you’re in a new virtual environment, activate it first.
   - Then install required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install pybullet pybullet_data numpy matplotlib torch
     ```
   - Or if you have a `requirements.txt` file, use:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Azure ML (Optional):**
   - Create or open your Azure Machine Learning compute instance.
   - Clone this repo or copy files into your compute workspace.
   - Install the same dependencies with `pip install ...`.

## Usage

### 1. Run a Basic Simulation
- **`simulate_robot.py`** (example):
  ```bash
  python simulate_robot.py
  ```
  This script uses PyBullet in DIRECT mode, loads a robot URDF, and steps the simulation to collect data. It saves the results to a `.npy` file.

### 2. Naive Control Loop
- **`single-joint-system.py`**:
  ```bash
  python single-joint-system.py
  ```
  This script demonstrates a simple torque-control approach on one of the robot’s joints. It records the resulting state trajectory to `control_loop_output.npy`.

### 3. Plot and Analyze Data
- Load `.npy` files in Python to visualize angles and velocities over time:
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  data = np.load("control_loop_output.npy")
  plt.plot(data[:,0], label="Joint Angle")
  plt.plot(data[:,1], label="Joint Velocity")
  plt.legend()
  plt.show()
  ```

### 4. Train a Hamiltonian Neural Network (Prototype)
- **`train_hnn.py`**:
  ```bash
  python train_hnn.py
  ```
  This script uses PyTorch to learn a Hamiltonian from your simulation data. It’s a basic template to illustrate how you might structure an HNN training loop.

### 5. Validate the HNN
- **`validate_hnn.py`**:
  ```bash
  python validate_hnn.py
  ```
  Compares the HNN-predicted trajectories against the PyBullet data to gauge how well the model captures the system’s dynamics.

## Results
- **Control Loop Outputs:**  
  You’ll find `.npy` files like `control_loop_output.npy` or `robot_arm_data.npy`.  
- **HNN Training (if used):**  
  - A `.pth` file (e.g., `hnn_robot_arm.pth`) containing the trained model parameters.
  - Plots or logs showing loss over epochs, or trajectory comparisons.

## Future Work
- **Integrate Control Inputs into HNN:** Make the HNN aware of external torques/forces.
- **Multi-Joint Systems:** Expand the naive control loop to handle multiple joints simultaneously.
- **Advanced Control Strategies:** Explore Model Predictive Control (MPC) or reinforcement learning with the HNN as a learned dynamics model.
- **Experiment Tracking:** Use Azure ML’s experiment tracking to log metrics, compare runs, and register models.
